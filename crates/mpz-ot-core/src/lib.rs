//! Low-level crate containing core functionalities for oblivious transfer protocols.

//! This crate is not intended to be used directly. Instead, use the higher-level APIs provided by

//! # ⚠️ Warning ⚠️
//!
//! Some implementations make assumptions about invariants which may not be checked if using these
//! low-level APIs naively. Failing to uphold these invariants may result in security vulnerabilities.
